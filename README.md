# benchmark-solarsystem
This is a benchmark involving ChatGPT, Deepseek and Qwen 2.5

The purpose of the project is very simple. I asked for something a little complex, like creating a solar system simulation, and I just asked for it to be created on the web, using Next.js. I won't make any changes, all the code will be inside their respective AIs, I'll just take the instruction and try to run it.

The date of this benchmark is February 6, 2025.
